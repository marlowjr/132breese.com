I was a guest on the [NB-YaY Podcat](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/late-night-nb-yay-nba-minisode-with-marlow-hicks/id1252186048?i=1000411805418&mt=2) hosted by [Jay Quiles](https://twitter.com/Jay_Quiles) and we had some fun. Took a look at the Conference Finals and the production that was the NBA Draft Lottery.  Also went over what the Bulls are going do with their lousy no good for nothing 7th overall pick.  It is a little different than our show but entertaining, check it out.
