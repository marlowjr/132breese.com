I was a guest on the [NB-YaY Podcat](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/late-night-nb-yay-nba-minisode-with-marlow-hicks/id1252186048?i=1000411805418&mt=2)hosted by [Jay Quiles](https://twitter.com/Jay_Quiles)and we had some fun.  Took a look at the Conference Finals and teh production that was the NBA Draft Lottery.  Also went over what the Bulls are going do with their lousy no good for nothing 7th overall pick.  It is a little differnt than our show but entertaining, check it out.
