<p>The guys interview the world famous <a href='www.twitter.com/djshawna'>DJ Shawna</a> ,  the official DJ of the Milwaukee Bucks, Marquette Basketball, and the Final Four, where they learn about her road from playing basketball to DJ. They pitch some ideas for their very own stage names and may have booked a pre game party.  A lot has gone on this week with, Laurel vs Yanny, the Royal Wedding, gambling is legal. They also dive back into the NBA playoffs, is Kevin Durant playing against 8th graders?  Casey&#39;s Hockey rooting pyramid is a mess with the Golden Knights making the Stanley Cup Finals.  We helped out HBO with Hard Knocks.   Mailbag questions are answered and Casey&#39;s Corner Kick.</p>
