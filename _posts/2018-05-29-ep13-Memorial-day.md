The guys relive their Memorial Day weekend were Casey became a wood builder and Marlow went all Wisconsin.  All the hot takes that were not correct from last episode. We see what is going on with our favorite couple Aaron Rodgers and Danica Patrick and the story on how they met.  Oh yea the NBA conference finals come to a close.  Mailbag with eSports fights + a very dramatic Casey's Corner kick.
