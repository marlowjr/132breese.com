### Show Notes:

Mailbag questions include:

- If you could only watch one players highlights for the rest of your life who would it be? 
- If you were major league baseball player, what would your walk up music be?Explain why we have any reason to believe in Greg Gard as Wisconsin’s Coach. I know that he was a key recruiter when Bo Ryan was the head coach, but when you are the head coach it’s a completely different ball game involving alumni relations, media and marketing, making literally every program decision. Mostly he looked scared this year.
- Please make your most educated guess as to where the following former badger basketball players are and what their current professions are: Alando Tucker, Michael Jackson, Brian butch, Jason Chappell, boo wade, Freddie Owens. 
- As we are almost at the NFL draft, have Bears fans yet come to terms with the Mitchell Trubisky pick?
- Marlow, you were and are a good athlete. If all your athletic accomplishments were on film, which would you most want MBHIII to see?
- why is your cover picture the flatiron building?
- Who do you feel would be the three most appropriate sponsors for your podcast?
