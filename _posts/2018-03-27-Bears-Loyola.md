Could 2 things come together better?  Loyola aka Chicago‚Äôs team with me firmly riding shotgun on the newly formed bandwagon getting national pub on the NFL network of all places. Nate Burleson stamping it with the seal a aprovel that the Bears are back, like I have stated and will continue to.  The Chicago centric spoken word was a little much but it did highlight the other greats to come out of Chicago. Shoutout Kanye, Chance, and Lupa. The fact that these guys and gal are spending an entire segment trying to find the next Loyola in the NFL shows that this Loyola team of team of men is getting the recognition they deserve.  

So now we have 2 Chicago teams in the one segment and we are talking about **Championships** not just games but Championships.  This could be the start of something special.  You might as well join in on the fun and just hop on for the ride.  I have said it once and I will say it again.  The Bears are back.
