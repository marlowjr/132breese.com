Easter weekend brought some revelations to the forefront.  We can now all agree that there are some creepy Easter Bunnies out there.  How parents continue to hand over their kids to some of these monsters is beyond me. . Oh yea the Final Four happened and News Flash Villanova can shoot the basketball beyond the 3 pt line.  Casey has a problem with how a Champion of College basketball is decided and provides plenty of hot take. Both Marlow & Casey had emotional reactions to the opening week of baseball.  A lot to get to in this episode and some good laughs.  Give it a listen you wonâ€™t be disappointed!
