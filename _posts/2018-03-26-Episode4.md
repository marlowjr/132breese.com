We take a review of the weekend Casey had in Chicago playing magic, watching the Sweet 16 & Elite 8, Twitch streaming and how Ninja makes money.  Marlow was so inspired he may dable in the streaming game.   The worst thing in the world to watch in a college basketball is 2 teams play a zone defense the whole game.  Are you still on team Sister Jean? Sam Darnold having his Pro Day and throwing in the rain is that a Big Deal?  Marlow trying out for professional football? 

Answers to all these burning questions and much much.  Take a listen below.
