<p>Well Game 1 of the NBA Finals was entertaining.  The guys recap Games 1 &amp; 2 and try to answer for what was J.R. Smith was doing.  LeBron has some fashion statements to answer for.  We take look at who took an L this past week.  Pusha T vs Drake.  Bryan Colangelo has way to many burnner Twiter accounts. Twitter goes wild over Roseanne. Marlow&#39;s breath is taken away by the Las Vegas Golden Knights pregame entertainment.  Mailbag questions from our listeners where we had to do some research.  Casey&#39;s Corner kick and much much more.</p>
