Born and raised all over this country (no I was not a military kid) I found a home when I set foot on the University of Wisconsin Campus. I spent the next four years pretending to be an athlete, majoring in partying, while trying to fit in school.  It all worked out in the end now that I have turned my everyday conversation with those friends into what we are calling a podcast.  

Currently living in Chicago in the shadows of Wriggly Feild, that I want to burn to the ground. 

Fan of:
- Badgers
- Bear
- Bulls
- White Sox
- Blackhawks

What else do you need?

Born and raised with an everything Wisconsin Fan; Badgers, Packers, Brewers, Bucks. During
my time at Wisconsin, I realized that one of the best parts of being a student is the commodore
that comes along from the shared experiences, but most notably of rooting for the Badgers.
With this podcast, I am hoping that we can continue sharing such experiences with our Fellow
Fans as we root for, or against, our teams.
